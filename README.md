## üìñ Overview

<div align="justify">

DunongLaya is a digital platform developed for **The AXIS**, the official student publication of Batangas State University ‚Äì TNEU Alangilan Campus. The AXIS serves the university community by covering campus news, student activities, and academic developments through their annual print edition and digital content.

The platform addresses problems with social media publishing: limited content access, fragmented reading, and the lack of engagement tools. DunongLaya replaces this approach with a centralized digital system that complements their print edition, providing enhanced content management, detailed analytics, and improved reader interaction.

The platform serves as both a content management system for publication staff and an engaging reading experience for the university community.

## üéØ Problem & Solution

**The Problem:**
The AXIS publishes an annual print edition but used social media platforms for digital content, which caused several issues:

- Digital articles were mixed with other posts, making them hard to find and organize
- No cohesive bridge between their print publication and digital presence 
- Limited analytics compared to dedicated publishing platforms
- Difficulty in building a professional digital archive that complements their print legacy

**The Solution:**
DunongLaya provides a dedicated digital platform that:

- Complements their annual print edition with professional digital presence
- Organizes all digital content in a searchable, publication-focused environment
- Provides detailed analytics specifically designed for publication needs
- Builds a permanent digital archive that enhances their established print tradition

## ‚ú® Features

### üîß For Administrators
- Full access to article management
- Access to analytics dashboard
- Manage publication staff accounts
- Supervise all platform operations

### üìù For Publication Staff
- Secure login with role-based access

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Development

<div align="justify">

The platform operates with three user types designed for publication workflow:

- **Admins** supervise all platform operations
- **Publication Staff** control the article workflow and track performance data 
- **Readers** interact with published content

Built using **Agile Development Model** with iterative development cycles, allowing the team to adapt to changes and get feedback throughout the project. This approach was needed given the changing needs of student journalists and readers, unlike other models that require setting all requirements first and limit user feedback until the end.

</div>

## üíª Technology Stack

<div align="justify">

- **Flutter SDK 3.32** for cross-platform development (Android and Web)
- **Mobile-first responsive design** ensuring accessibility across devices
- Chosen for rapid prototyping and single codebase deployment

Flutter was selected because it allowed the team to create both mobile and web versions simultaneously, crucial for reaching The AXIS's diverse readership across different devices and platforms.
