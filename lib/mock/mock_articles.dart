    content: 'The Alangilan Lady Spikers fell short as Pablo Borbon seized the early momentum and secured victory at the Intramurals volleyball finals. Pablo Borbon pulled off a shocking final sweep against the home favorites from Alangilan, who were plagued by unforced errors. Alangilan’s middle blocker Abegael Manalo led the team on both ends with 15 points, including four blocks, but her efforts weren\'t enough to secure the crown. In the opening set, the Lady Spikers already had seven errors, gifting momentous points to Pablo Borbon, who took advantage and secured the first set, 25-20. Pablo Borbon built on their momentum and started to pull ahead in the second set, but Manalo came alive to provide crucial defensive touches and scoring key points midway through. As both teams traded errors and broke deadlocks late in the second set, Alangilan had a chance to extend the game with a 24-22 lead, but Pablo Borbon’s clutch defense, including two blocks and a forced error, sealed the set, 26-24, handing the Lady Spikers a heartbreaking loss at home and a silver finish. Despite the loss, Alangilan Campus was hailed as the overall champions of the University-Wide Intramurals.',

    content: 'Alangilan Spikers’ strategy and deception sealed a 2-0 win over JPLC-Malvar in the men’s volleyball championship. Twin-towers Neil Joshua Abutal and Mark Justine Nier snapped the neck-and-neck start of the opening set, aiding in AL’s hard-earned seven-point edge, 12-5, at the first-half of the set. However, JPLC-Malvar came back stronger in the latter half as they redeemed the tight match through decoys and sneaky drops, consequently breaking AL’s momentum that forced the game into a deuce, but the AL Spikers resisted their futile efforts, owning the first set after a thrilling rally, 27-25. Meanwhile, Red Spartan Spikers wasted no time in the second set, starting strong with Nier’s resounding 3-0 effort. Alangilan pulled off their well-timed misdirections that caught Malvar off-guard in the first half of the second salvo. With Malvar gradually regaining their composure back in the late stretch of the second set, history seemed to repeat itself as the Alangilan Spikers successfully escaped the 25-23 closer.',

    content: 'Alangilan’s Shemaiah Barcelona overcame a twice-to-beat disadvantage to clinch the Women’s Singles A badminton championship against Pablo Borbon. Nagrehistro ng malaking kawang sa palitan ng mga pulidong ratsada si Barcelona sa first match, sapat para pawiin ang kumpiyansa mula sa winning-bracket na ipinoste ni Arellano, 14-8. Bumubulusok na solidong smashes at service ace ang isinumite ni Barcelona sa pagitan ng kanilang patuloy na tunggalian upang mapukol ang sigurado nitong pag-ariba sa susunod na sultada, 25-20. Tuluyan nang umubra ang kalmadong pagmamaniobra ni Barcelona sa pagtungtong ng second match matapos paamuhin at kalasin ang natitirang kisig mula kay Arellano at tuldukan ang laban sa iskor na 25-17. The days before the u-wide, unfortunately, so many bad things kept happening, kaya sabi ko sa sarili ko, \'I needed to win\', so that meron akong redemption era, ani Barcelona. And kaya rin kasi matibay ang loob ko pagdating sa court is because of my parents... during the game, I kept kissing my cross pendant as it reminds me of them, dagdag niya. Tinambalan naman ni Lei Yves Suarez ang gintong titulo sa Mens Single A nang silatin nito ang kampeonato kontra kay Ric Symon Bacon ng Lipa, upang itarak ang kaniyang sunod-sunod na tagumpay magmula sa kaniyang pamamayagpag sa nagdaang Angaras Cup at Lamb Intramurals.

    content: 'Alangilan dominated the badminton doubles finals as both men’s and women’s teams secured championships after intense matches at Sparta Gymnasium. Atienza-Salagubang duo\'s vie for the gold in the men’s division set off to a gritty start until half the game, bringing the match into a tie, 15-15. However, Alangilan power smashers did not let the rival Lipa stand a chance on their twice-to-beat standing as they carved up momentous four straight points, 19-15, installing their winning momentum until the final stretch with victory on their hand, 25-18. Malubay-Mendeja tandem, on the other hand, set their title bid in style as they own eight consecutive rallies to secure the first half with wide edge among Katiah Moscoso and Kenn Salvacion of Pablo Borbon. Opposing team did not falter as they catch up on Alangilan’s score, feeding up on Malubay’s struggle to bring the shuttlecock over the net leading to thrilling ties, 23-23, 24-24 but Pablo Borbon gave away the crucial single point with an unforced error at the baseline to end the thrilling exchange of flicks, 25-24. Magtiwala po sa isa’t-isa since kami po yung magkadoubles, kami lang po yung magtutulungan sa loob, kami lang po yung magtutulungan sa loob, Malubay said when asked the strategy that capped the nail-biting match point.',

    content: 'Alangilan Dribblers lost another close match to ARASOF-Nasugbu, 38–35, falling short in the Women’s Basketball finals. Facing the twice-to-beat disadvantage, Alangilan geared up for another clash with Nasugbu to claim the women’s crown. With their guns out early by opening tip-off, Alangilan fired away nine quick points right off the bat led by Micah Nicolette Rodelas and Aira Erigbuagas, but Nasugbu answered back with an eight-point run to keep the game at their toes, ending the half at 18 a-piece. Entering the final half, Alangilan tried to keep their series alive at a disadvantage as Sharmane Abrahan and Jeferjean Balacanao brought their team in pace, yet Nasugbu flared at the last two minute mark with eight straight points to raise the lead by five and inch closer for the gold. Abraham had two costly turnovers in the end, making their championship hopes meet its end, with Nasugbu closing it at 38-35 tally. Same with the Men’s team, the women’s upped their game to show as a contending team for a U-Wide setting, worthy of a crown.',
